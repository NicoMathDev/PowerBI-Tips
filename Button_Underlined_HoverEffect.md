# Underline Hover Effect in Button

We can create an underline hover effect natively in Power BI. First just insert a button and a line, adjust the colors of both objects (for this solution the button must have the same fill as the background color where it will be), after that align the objects.

Order the line behind the button, then select the button and change the fill color to transparent.

Group both objects together and your hover underlined button is complete.
